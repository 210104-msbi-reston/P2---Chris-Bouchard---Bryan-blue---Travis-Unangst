# Vinyl Record Marketplace

## Description
Our project will provide an easy way to view, search, and buy vinyl records worldwide. There will be a multitude of different ways to filter search results to find the records you want.

## Automation
1. Data scrape information on vinyl records from https://www.discogs.com/ using python
2. Store data collected into multiple .csv files
3. Data processing: read data from .csv files and store it on a SQL database using SSIS
4. Data creation: randomly generate sales data for records and upload it to a SQL data warehouse via SSIS
5. Allow user to search/view data based on following criteria using SSAS:
* Band
* Album
* Country Released
* Date Released
* Genre
* Style
* Price
* Location sold
* Time sold
6. Generate SSRS reports on search/views/orders
7. Generate Power BI revenue reports based on genre, artist, country, etc.
